## Project Insights
- Item  1 generated more revenue, contributing about 36% of total revenue. Followed by item 5 with about 24%. 
- The top 10 performing company by revenue average 111,000  with company D and company S contributing 123,000 & 122,000 respectively. 
- Identified the 1st and 2nd quarter as the pick period for revenue generation. 

## Final conclusion
The missing data for the month of November and December 2019 creates some level of bias in the report. Item 3 contributed just about 6% of total revenue. Hence, a strategic marketing plan should be done to boost the revenue from item 3 while optimizing delivery of item 1 and item 5 for an overall revenue boost.
